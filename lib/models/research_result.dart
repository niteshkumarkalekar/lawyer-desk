The present writ petition was filed challenging this notice.", actsAndLaws: ["The Securitisation And Reconstruction Of Financial Assets And Enforcement Of Security Interest Act, 2002", "R.T.I. Act", "Hindu Marriage Act, 1955"], judgements: Judgement.sampleJudgements, evidences: "Significantly, having mentioned the fact that there was only one bidder in the said auction held on 31.03.2017, the bank deliberately did not disclose the fact that it was the fourth respondent company. This fact was however disclosed by the fourth respondent company and is also evident from the record. The attempt on the part of the bank to withhold this piece of information does not reflect well upon it as the bank is expected to be forthright in all respects while placing the facts before this Court. However, that by itself is not sufficient to draw an inference that the bank and the fourth respondent company are in collusion to defeat the interest of the petitioner company. Further, the offer made by the fourth respondent company to withdraw from the sale even now clearly bears out its bonafides. This contention of the petitioner company is therefore without merit", questions: "Whether the responsibility to recover the defaulted credit is taken over by the Trust after the settlement of claim (issuance of 1st Instalment of claim) in respect of particular borrower account?", templates: "No templates");

        title: "M/S Pochiraju Industries Ltd vs Punjab National Bank And Others on 19 January, 2018", finalJudgement: "The writ petition is accordingly allowed. The impugned e-auction sale notice dated 01.07.2017 is declared illegal, being in violation of Rule 8(5) of the Rules of 2002 in so far as the reserve price fixed therein is concerned. In consequence, the auction sale held on 24.07.2017 is also declared illegal. However, as the fourth respondent already parted with its monies to the extent of 25% of the sale consideration offered by it, the bank shall refund the same with interest at the highest rate applicable to its fixed deposits as on date. This order shall however not preclude the bank from initiating measures afresh in accordance with the prescribed procedure under the SARFAESI Act for realizing its dues from the petitioner company."),
    Judgement(title: "V. Rama Naidu And Another vs Smt. V.Ramadevi on 31 January, 2018", finalJudgement: " From the above, as there is no hard and fast rule of in which case commissioner to be appointed and in which it is not, by the Court of its own without even application, but for what are the illustrative matters referred by the Apex Court in Salem Bar Association case II in 2005, it is in complicated factual matters involved Court generally record evidence at least of main witnesses and appoint advocate commissioner to record evidence of other witnesses more particularly from pressure of work and work load with huge pendency in almost all courts and therefrom coming to the facts, merely because the defendants dispute the suit sale agreement as forged and fabricated one and did not execute and did not enter sale agreement, by itself it cannot be said the suit involves complicated questions of fact for only to record by Court the evidence even after the party witness PW.1 in cross examination. Thus the appointment of a commissioner by Court of its own by virtue of the enabling provision under Order XVIII Rule 19 r/w Rules 4 & 5 and Order XXVI Rules 4 & 4A CPC cannot be find fault including from the guidelines in the expression of Salem Bar Association case II. Thus, the revision deserves dismissal for the impugned order no way requires interference."),
    Judgement(title: "M/S. Universal Cables Limited & Others vs State Of Andhra Pradesh & Others on 25 January, 2018", finalJudgement: "The Supreme Court while upholding the pre-qualification criteria for award of tenders prescribed by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, it was observed that a Court cannot interfere with the terms of the tender prescribed by the government because it feels that some other terms would have been fair, wiser or logical. If the government acts in conformity with certain healthy standards and norms such as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in those circumstances, the interference by Courts is very limited. The Bench further observed that a Court before interfering in tender or contractual matters, in exercise of the power of judicial review, should pose to itself the following questions: (i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or intended to favour someone, or so arbitrary and irrational that the court can say the decision is such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could have reached and (ii) Whether the public interest is affected. If the answers are in the negative, then there should be no interference under Article 226. The decision of this Court in BHARAT BIOTECT INTERNATIONAL LIMITEDs case (1 supra) is not applicable to the facts of this case. In that case this Court found that there was only one manufacturer of vaccine supply with WHO pre-qualification and the State had definite information that only one such manufacturer exists, yet for mysterious reasons the State chose to call for tenders, which was held to be tailor-made to suit only one person. The context in which that decision is rendered is different as imposing the stipulation of WHO pre-qualification certificate for participating in the tender was challenged, but in the present case challenge is on a different ground. The decisions of the Delhi High Court in DHINGRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANYs case (2 supra) and in GHARDA CHEMICALS LIMITEDs case (3 supra) are also not applicable to the facts of the instant case. Admittedly, there are more than one bidders in the fray in this case and it is not the case of monopoly and the concept of fair competition is not subverted."),
    Judgement(title: "Nandi Narsimlu vs K. Ramana Reddy And Another on 29 January, 2018", finalJudgement: "Section 147 of the Act mandates compulsory coverage against death of or bodily injury to any passenger of \"public service vehicle\". The proviso makes it further clear that compulsory coverage in respect of drivers and conductors of public service vehicle and employees carried in goods vehicle would be limited to liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923. The provisions of the Act do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger traveling in a goods carriage and the insurer would have no liability therefor. The said proposition of law was laid in Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v. Devi Reddy Konda Reddy . The goods carriage carrying any passenger is not contemplated under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Baljit Kaur , it was held that the intention of Parliament could not have been that the words 'any person' occurring in Section 147 would cover all persons who were travelling in a goods carriage in any capacity whatsoever. In the instant case, the appellant traveled in the tractor-trailer as an unauthorized passenger and further there is no insurance coverage for the appellant under the insurance policy."),
    Judgement(title: "The Food Corporation Of India, Rep. By ... vs M/S.Sri Surya Chandra Raw And Boiled ... on 18 January, 2018", finalJudgement: " It is next contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the defendants, having participated in the tender process and having entered into agreement, cannot resile from the same on untenable grounds, cannot be accepted for the reason that admittedly, defendants withdrew the offer on 02.01.1987 and they have also failed to pay 7 % of security deposit in pursuant to the letter addressed by the plaintiffs Corporation, as per the terms of the contract, as such there is no concluded contract between the plaintiffs Corporation and the defendants. That apart, as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the defendants, which was also observed by the Court below that the plaintiffs Corporation never protested about withdrawal of offer by the defendants from 1987 till 1989, in subsequent correspondence between them."),
    Judgement(title: "Kolluri Rajeswari And Another vs 1.K. Anjaneyulu And 2 Others on 29 January, 2018", finalJudgement: "As shown in the above tabular format, the appellants are entitled to the compensation more than claimed by them. By following the principle laid down in Nagappa Vs. Gurudayal Singh , wherein the Honble Supreme Court opined that since the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act have no restriction on the quantum of compensation that can be awarded in appropriate cases where, from the evidence brought on record, the Courts feel that the claimant is entitled to more compensation than claimed, the Courts may award such compensation, and the only embargo is that the compensation so awarded should be just, and should neither be arbitrary, fanciful nor unjustifiable from the evidence brought on record. Therefore, keeping in view the ratio laid down in Nagappa, the compensation of Rs.14,25,576/- is awarded to the claimants."),
    Judgement(title: "Patnam Parvatamma And Four Others vs Balraju And Another on 29 January, 2018", finalJudgement: "The assessment made by the Tribunal with regard to the monthly income of the deceased is not correct inasmuch as it may not be possible to guess as to the number of days in a month a person has actually worked and, therefore, the assessment of the Tribunal that the deceased must have worked for 24 days, for, the remaining days are festivals, holidays or that the deceased might have suffered ill health, is not based on proper inference or reasoning. In the case of a person working as an unskilled labourer in an unorganised sector, keeping in view the ratio laid down by the Honble Supreme Court in Ramesh Singh v. Satbir Singh , New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Smt. Shanti Pathak , Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Syed Ibrahim , New India Assurance Co. Ltd., v. Kalpana (Smt) , a decision of High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in Sri Appayachari v. K. Vadivel and the New India Assurance Company Ltd., rep. by its Manager and a decision of High Court of Calcutta in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shri Buro Mahara , the Courts are generally taking the notional income as Rs.3,000/- per month for the purpose of calculation of compensation. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the deceased was working as labour maistry. Though it is the evidence of PW1 that the deceased was earning Rs.5,000/- per month, there is no documentary proof to that effect. Keeping in view the ratio laid down by the Apex Court in the aforesaid decisions in Ramesh Singh, and taking into consideration that the deceased was a labour maistry (mason), his monthly income can be safely assumed to be higher than that of an unskilled labourer working in an unorganised sector and, therefore, it would meet the ends of justice if the notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration as Rs.4,000/- per month for the purpose of calculation of compensation."),
